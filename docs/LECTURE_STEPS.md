## 🔧 1. Lesson 106 — *Setting Up the "usePopcorn" project*

### 🧠 1.1 Context  
This lesson focuses on setting up the initial project structure for "usePopcorn", a movie rating and discovery application. We'll initialize a new React project using Vite, configure the development environment, and establish the foundation for building a component-based application. The project will demonstrate React best practices including component composition, state management, and reusability patterns. This setup phase is crucial as it establishes the project architecture and development workflow that will be used throughout the section.

## 🔧 2. Lesson 107 — *How to split  a UI into components* 

### 🧠 2.1 Context  
This lesson teaches the fundamental skill of breaking down a user interface into logical, reusable React components. We'll explore the principles of component design, including when to create new components, how to determine appropriate component size, and strategies for identifying component boundaries. The lesson covers practical guidelines for component composition, emphasizing the balance between too-small components (over-engineering) and too-large components (monolithic code). Understanding these concepts is essential for building maintainable, scalable React applications and is a core skill in "thinking in React".
